This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

Commands
- Help - this lists all the items available to pick up, furniture in the room you can go to, NPCs in the room you can go to, and other rooms you can visit from your current location
- Inventory - this will tell you what you are holding in either your hands or the satchel
- Go to - allows you to move to a new place
- Eat - this allows you to eat an item that is in your inventory
- Talk - if you are at an NPC, this command will allow you to talk to them
- Take or Pick up - this allows you to add an item to your inventory
- Drop - this removes an item from your inventory

Helpful Hints
- you start the game with only two slots in your inventory, you must obtain the satchel to get unlimited inventory (see mini-game cheats)
- when going to a new room you must say "place name" + door
- you can only eat items if they are in your inventory
- you must go to a npc before you try to talk to them

Mini-Game Cheats
- Expand inventory: if you go to the locked cabinet in the storage room, pickup the pain meds, and take them to the old rat in the hidey hole, the old rat will give you a satchel that expands your inventory
- locked cabinet code: 3345
- Free other rats: the rat translator in the storage closet will allow you to talk to the kid, who will give you keys to free the other rats after answering the riddle correctly
- answer to kid riddle: "butterfly"
